# lfstat

The [Manual on Low-flow Estimation and
Prediction](https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=7699),
published by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), gives a
comprehensive summary on how to analyse stream flow data focusing on
low-flows. This packages provides functions to compute the described
statistics and produces plots similar to the ones in the manual.
