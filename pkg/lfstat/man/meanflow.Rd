\title{
Mean flow
}
\description{
Calculates the meanflow of an object of class 'lfobj'.
}
\usage{
meanflow(lfobj, year = "any", monthly = FALSE, yearly = FALSE,
breakdays = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{lfobj}{An object of class "lfobj"
}
  \item{year}{
The year for which the meanflow should be computed. If hyearstart != 1 the meanflow is calculated for the hydrological year! "any" means the whole series should be taken.
}
  \item{monthly}{
logical - Should the meanflow be calculated separately for every month?.
}
  \item{yearly}{
logical - If TRUE,  the meanflow is calculated for each hydrological year separately.
}
 \item{breakdays}{
A vector of breakdays if the meanflow should be calculated for different seasons.
}
\item{na.rm}{Should missing values be ignored?}
}
\details{
If breakdays is a single day, e.g. "01/06", the start of the hydrological year is taken as the second breakday. If more than two seasons are to be specified, a vector of all breakdays is needed.
}

\value{
A length one vector giving the meanflow for the whole series or the specified
year. If yearly is true, a vector of the annual mean flows is returned. If
breakdays are specified, the values are separated per season.
