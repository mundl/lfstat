\title{Calculate the base flow of a river}
\description{
Given a stream flow hydrograph of flows (regular time series), the base flow is separated. The minima of a period (default \code{block.len = 5)} is calculated and turning points are identified. At turning points the base flow equals the actual flow, in between, linear interpolation is carried out. }
\usage{
baseflow(x, tp.factor = 0.9, block.len = 5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{numeric vector containing flows}
  \item{tp.factor}{numeric vector of length one. Towards high flows, allow the
  central value of three consecutive minima only to be of a factor
  \code{(1 - tp.factor)} higher than the surrounding values}
  \item{block.len}{numeric vector of length one. }
}
\value{A numeric vector of \code{length(x)}. It contains \code{NA}s as until the
first turning point, the base flow cannot be determined.}
