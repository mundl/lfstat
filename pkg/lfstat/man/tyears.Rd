\title{
Calculate Low-Flow Quantiles for given Return Periods
}

\description{Fits an extreme value distribution using \var{L}-moments to the minima of a time series of discharges and subsequently estimates quantiles (the so called \var{T}-years event) for given return periods. In the presence of zero flow observations a mixed distribution is fitted.
}
\usage{
tyears(lfobj, event = 1/probs, probs = 0.01,
       dist = "wei", check = TRUE, zeta = zetawei, zetawei = NULL,
       plot = TRUE, col = 1, log = TRUE, legend = TRUE,
       rp.axis = "top", rp.lab = "Return period",
       freq.axis = TRUE,
       freq.lab = expression(paste("Frequency " *(italic(F)),
                                   " = Non-Exceedance Probability P ",
                                   (italic(X) <= italic(x)))),
       xlab = expression("Reduced variate,  " * -log(-log(italic(F)))),
       ylab = "Quantile",
       hyearstart = hyear_start(lfobj),
       n = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{lfobj}{An object of class \code{'lfobj'} or an object which can be coerced to class \code{'xts'}. Either with a single column or with a column named \code{'discharge'}.}
  \item{event}{numeric vector specifying the return periods. E.g. \code{event = 100} will yield the 100 years extreme low flow event.}
  \item{probs}{Alternate way to specify the return period of the event.}
  \item{dist}{A character vector of distributions to fit. Basically all distributions provided by Hosking's \code{\link[lmom]{lmom-package}} and their reversed counterparts can be chosen.}
  \item{check}{logical, should \code{\link{check_distribution}} get called?}
    \item{zeta}{numeric vector of length one for manually setting a lower bound. Only a few distributions allow for a lower bound, namely \code{'gpa'}, \code{'ln3'}, \code{'wak'} and \code{'wei'}. The default value of \code{NULL} results in not bounding the distribution, therefore the parameter \code{zeta} is estimated.}
  \item{zetawei}{same as \code{zeta}}
  \item{plot}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, sample observations as well as estimated quantile functions are plotted.}
  \item{col}{numeric or character vector of length one or as long as \code{dist}, specifying the colour used for plotting.}
  \item{log}{logical. If \code{TRUE} probabilities will be plotted on a double logarithmic scale.}
  \item{legend}{logical, should a legend be added to the plot?}
  \item{rp.axis}{vector of length one, specifying if and how an additional scale bar for the return periods is drawn. Possible choices are \code{'bottom'}, \code{'top'} and \code{'none'}. Alternatively, the position of the scale bar can be specified as an real number between 0 and 1, indicating the y-position of the legend.}
  \item{rp.lab}{character vector, text above the scale bar for return periods}
  \item{freq.axis}{logical, should an additional abscissa showing the probabilities be drawn on top of the plot?}
  \item{freq.lab}{character vector, text above the probability axis}
  \item{xlab}{character vector, a label for the x axis}
  \item{ylab}{character vector, a label for the y axis}
  \item{hyearstart}{vector of length one, providing the start of the hydrological year. This is evaluated by \code{\link{water_year}}. The default is, to retrieve the values stored in the attributes of the \code{lfobj}.}
  \item{n}{Argument 'n' is deprecated and ignored. To apply a moving average, do it prior to calling \code{'tyears'}. See section Examples.}
}


\details{
This function is vectorised over \code{dist} and \code{event}.


According to paragraph 7.4.2 of the \acronym{WMO} manual, special care has to be taken in the presence of zero flow observations. A cdf called G(x) is fitted to the non-zero values of the original  time series

If a distribution is fitted which allows for finite lower bound (\code{zeta}), and \code{zeta} is estimated being negative, estimation is repeated constraining \code{zeta = 0}. If this behavior is not desired, the parameter \code{zeta} has to be set explicitly.
