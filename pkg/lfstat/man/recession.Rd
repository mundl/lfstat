\title{
Recession Constant
}
\description{
Does recession analysis using either the MRC (Master recession curve) or
IRS (individual recession segments) method.
}
\usage{
recession(lfobj,
          method = c("MRC", "IRS"),
          seglength,
          threshold,
          peaklevel = 0.95,
          seasonbreakdays = NULL,
          thresbreaks = c("fixed", "monthly","seasonal"),
          thresbreakdays = NULL,
          plotMRC = TRUE,
          trimIRS = 0,
          na.rm = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{lfobj}{An object of class "lfobj"}
  \item{method}{"MRC" or "IRS"}
  \item{seglength}{The length of the duration segments - see the WMO-manual
    and use \code{\link{seglenplot}} to choose a good value.}
  \item{threshold}{The threshold level (70 means Q70)}
  \item{peaklevel}{A level between 0 and 1 or a logical vector, see
    details.}
  \item{seasonbreakdays}{A vector of breakdays. Needed if the recession
    constant should be calculated individually for different seasons, see
  details.}
  \item{thresbreaks}{"fixed" uses a fixed threshold level, "monthly"
    calculates the threshold for every month separately, "seasonal"
    calculates thresholds for every season defined using
    "thresbreakdays".}
  \item{thresbreakdays}{Needed if \code{thresbreaks = 'seasonal'} to define
    the periods for which separate thresholds should be calculated, see
    details}
  \item{plotMRC}{logical, if TRUE and "method = 'MRC'" a plot like
    figure 5.4 in the manual is given.}
  \item{trimIRS}{Should a trimmed mean be used for calculating the
    IRS-constant? (0 means no, 0.1 means trim by 10 \%)}
  \item{na.rm}{Should NAs in the series be ignored?}
}

\details{
For recession analysis it is necessary to define flood discharge peaks
in the hydrograph. Peaklevel defines a day to be a
discharge peak, if peaklevel * flow > flow[day before] and
peaklevel * flow > flow[day after]. Use \code{\link{recessionplot}}
to find a good level or hand a logical vector where TRUE means rain peak.

If thresbreakdays or seasonbreakdays is a single day, e.g. "01/06", the start of the hydrological year is taken as the second breakday. If more than two seasons are to be specified, a vector of all breakdays is needed.
}

\value{
The overall recession rate in days. If seasons are defined a rate for
every season is calculated.
