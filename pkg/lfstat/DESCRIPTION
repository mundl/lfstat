Description: The "Manual on Low-flow Estimation and Prediction", published by
    the World Meteorological Organisation (\acronym{WMO}), gives a comprehensive summary on
    how to analyse stream flow data focusing on low-flows. This packages provides
    functions to compute the described statistics and produces plots similar to the
    ones in the manual.
