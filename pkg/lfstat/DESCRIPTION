Title: Calculation of Low Flow Statistics for Daily Stream Flow Data
Version: 0.9.5
Date: 2016-10-04
Author: Daniel Koffler, Tobias Gauster and Gregor Laaha

Description: The "Manual on Low-flow Estimation and Prediction", published by
    the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), gives a comprehensive summary on
    how to analyse stream flow data focusing on low-flows. This packages provides
    functions to compute the described statistics and produces plots similar to the
    ones in the manual.
